# examSys
This Exam System is designed to simplify the process of creating, managing, and taking exams. Instructors can easily create exams, add questions, and assign them to students. Students can log in, take their exams within a set time, and receive immediate feedback.

The system helps instructors track progress, and securely stores all exam data in a database. Built with Java and Spring Boot for the backend, React for the frontend, and SQL for database management, the system aims to make the exam process efficient and user-friendly for both instructors and students.
